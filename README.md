# MyAnimalSetup
Work in progress, being updated pretty regularly right now.
HUGE thanks to the creators of the mods RealisticLivestock and AnimalPackage_vanillaEdition.

This is just a collection of files from there for a unified animal package to move around my saves. I've started modifying the i3d models provided in AnimalPackage to work with realisticLivestock (ear tags, bumIds, markers, monitors), thus why I don't simply reference those FS25_ mod directories. That would've been much easier.


This change may impact existing animals, especially modded ones.
It's best to do this with a fresh game on a map with default animals. 


## Installation Instructions

Super simple.
Extract this repo in modSettings, I used a directory called MyAnimals.
Drop rlSettings.xml into your save game directory if one already exists. Make sure that points to the realisticLivestock.xml file in the new directory.

Boot into your save, and you'll have animals!


You can also set the path to realisticLivestock.xml via the in-game Realistic Livestock Settings section, but requires a restart of your save after setting the config. By dropping the file, RL will load these animals on first boot.
